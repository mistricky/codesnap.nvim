## Prerequirements
- Neovim 9.0+

## Install
Recommend using [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for installation, but you can still use another plugin manager you prefer.

**Lazy.nvim**
```lua
{ "mistricky/codesnap.nvim", build = "make", version = "^1" },
```

### Build manually
Since v0.0.1 was released, the CodeSnap.nvim will cross-compile for the following three targets, then the CodeSnap.nvim will automatically determine which package to use based on your system, you no longer need to have Rust environment if everything goes smoothly.
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- x86_64-apple-darwin
- aarch64-apple-darwin

If CodeSnap.nvim on your system still not works fine, there are a lot of reasons depending on your system arch or OS version, well you can try to build CodeSnap manually using the following config:
```lua
{ "mistricky/codesnap.nvim", build = "make build_generator", version = "^1" },
```

## Usage 
`CodeSnap.nvim` provides the following two ways to take snapshots of currently selected code

### Copy into the clipboard
To take a beautiful snapshot use CodeSnap.nvim, you can just use `CodeSnap` command to generate a snapshot of the current selected code, then the `CodeSnap.nvim` will write the snapshot into the clipboard, and you can paste it anywhere you want.

### Save the snapshot

Of course, you can use `CodeSnapSave` command to save the snapshot to path where you defined it in `config.save_path`
```lua
require("codesnap").setup({
  -- ...
  save_path: ...
})
```

## Watermark
Watermark is something that makes screenshots more personalized, but if you don't like watermark just set it as empty string to hide it.
```lua
require("codesnap").setup({
  -- ...
  watermark: ""
})
```

## Commands
```shell
CodeSnap # Take a snapshot of the currently selected code and copy the snapshot into the clipboard

CodeSnapSave # Save the snapshot of the currently selected code and save it on the disk
```

## Configuration
Define your custom config using `setup` function
```lua
require("codesnap").setup({...})
```

There is a default config:
```lua
{
    mac_window_bar = true,
    title = "CodeSnap.nvim",
    code_font_family = "CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font",
    watermark_font_family = "Pacifico",
    watermark = "CodeSnap.nvim",
}
```
